## File Manager Application

### Requirements

#### Application should:
- Should look visually like Total Commander (have two windows).
- Show a catalogue inside every window.
- Show an appropriate icon for different file types
- Show files attributes (file name, extension, file size, date created etc).
- Ability to show/hide some file attributes.
- Ability to sort files by name, size etc.
- Support file/folders operations: copy, move, rename, delete.<br />


  _Note: paste option becomes enabled when you copied or cut an item. 
    <br /> To paste an item you should right-click on a directory where it has to be copied or moved._


- Copying should be handled like in Total Commander from one window to another
- Show progress bar during the operation - **_not implemented_**
- When file/folder is copying, user still can browse the app.
- Non-blocking UI â€“ it should not freeze while using the app.
- Show dialog windows (like confirm deleting etc.)
- Compile for Linux and Windows.
